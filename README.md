## THINK Lab System Dynamics/Vensim Tutorial

We will use the system dynamics (SD) modelling software Vensim for this tutorial.
Please use the correct installer for your operating system:
- "InstallVensimPLE.dmg" for Mac
- "VensimPLEx64Setup.exe" for Windows 64-bit

After Vensim PLE is installed, download the three "Vensim Model Files" and place them in their own folder anywhere on your computer.
These are the 3 model files:
- SIR_Model_Tutorial.mdl
- SIR_Model_Tutorial.2mdl
- Baseline.vdfx
