## THINK Lab System Dynamics/Vensim Tutorial

We will use the system dynamics (SD) modelling software Vensim for this tutorial.

1. Please use the correct installer for your operating system:
- "InstallVensimPLE.dmg" for Mac
- "VensimPLEx64Setup.exe" for Windows 64-bit

If you have issues with either of these files, you may download the installer [from the Vensim website](https://vensim.com/free-downloads/).
Note that Vensim will ask for your email, then email you a link to download the installer.

2. After Vensim PLE is installed, download the five "Vensim Model Files" and place them together in a directory of their own.
These are the 3 model files:
- SIR_Model_Tutorial.mdl
- SIR_Model_Tutorial.2mdl
- Baseline.vdfx
- SIR_Model_Tutorial_Exercise.mdl
- SIR_Model_Tutorial_Exercise.2mdl
